/*c++ solution to question 4
I am in city “A”, my friend John is in a different city “B”, and my other friend
Ann is in yet another different city “C”. We want to find a city different from the
three cities we are in to meet so that the total number of connections among three
of us is minimized. Tell me the city we should fly to and the routes for us or tell
me there is no such a city.
