(txt file for now will turn this into google docs)
we can seperate/explain only the parts that we each worked on and present it in that order
'''
You will have to write a project report (about 2-4 pages – single space – 12pt font)
that includes:
- design issues, what are the problems and how you solve them
- data structures you use, the decision behind selecting them
- algorithms you employ, again with a justification of your decision
- particular emphasis should be placed on the running time of your algorithm,
please show the asymptotic costs for each of your algorithm
- optimization issues: what could you do to further optimize your algorithm
- you need to specifically address the problem of scalability: would you
implementation be efficient in the case of very large species collections for
larger scale geographic area?
- any other remarks about your design and implementation
